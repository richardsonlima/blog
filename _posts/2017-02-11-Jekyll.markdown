<img src="/images/fulls/jekyll.jpg" class="fit image"> Hi dear friends, I was transferred my professional blog from a Tumblr to Jekyll/GitHubPages because I liked the idea of writing a post using Markdown files and using git to push ( {% highlight bash %} git add file; git commit -m "hello"; git push -u origin master {% endhighlight %} ) the changes to my Github repository. In fact I add more speed and simplicity of having a static website/blog on a free solution using custom domain.
