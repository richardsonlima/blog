<img src="/images/fulls/jekyll.jpg" class="fit image"> Hi dear friends, I have transferred my professional blog from Tumblr to Jekyll/GitHubPages because I liked the idea of writing a post using Markdown files and using git to push ( git add file; git commit -m "hello"; git push -u origin master ) the changes to my Github repository. In fact I add more speed and simplicity of having a static website/blog on a free solution using custom domain.
